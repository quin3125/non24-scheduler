# Non24 Scheduler

**Non24 Scheduler** is a web-based tool that helps people with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (and anyone with non-standard routines) create calendar events that recur at custom, non-standard intervals. This makes it easy to plan and visualize unique schedules that don't fit typical daily or weekly recurrence patterns.

## Features

* **Custom Recurring Events:** Generate events that repeat every X hours and Y minutes, not just daily or weekly.
* **Flexible Start Time:** Choose your starting date, time (with 12-hour or 24-hour format), and time zone (auto-detected by default).
* **Duration & Interval Control:** Set precise event durations and intervals.
* **Bulk Generation:** Create up to 1,461 events (enough for four years of daily events) at once for long-term planning.
* **Accessibility:** Clean, responsive, and accessible interface with help text for all features.
* **Easy Export:** Download your events as a standard `.ics` file, compatible with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Proton Calendar, and more.

## Who is it for?

This app is designed primarily for people with **Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder** (sometimes called "non-24" or "free-running disorder"), a circadian rhythm disorder where a person's sleep schedule shifts each day. It is also useful for shift workers, polyphasic sleepers, and anyone who needs to schedule events at irregular intervals.

## How to Use

1. **Go to the app:** [https://quin3125.github.io/non24-scheduler/](https://quin3125.github.io/non24-scheduler/)
2. **Fill in the form:** Enter your event details, start date/time, duration, interval, time zone, and total number of events.
3. **Generate and download:** Click "Generate ICS" to create your custom .ics file, then download and import it into your favorite calendar app.

## Why Non24 Scheduler?

Most calendar apps do not support event recurrence at arbitrary time intervals. Non24 Scheduler fills this gap, making it easy to visualize and plan around a non-24-hour cycle.
